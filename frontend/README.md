### General components

Windmill Dashboard React is built on top of [Windmill React UI](https://windmillui.com/react-ui). You will find the documentation for every small component there.

### Example Boilerplate

All components and containers are saved in folder [example](example)

### Routing

Change default redirecting when hit the `/` or `home` in file [next.config.js](next.config.js)
```js
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/',
        destination: '/example/login',
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  }
```

#### Sidebar routes

To configure sidebar menus, see file ([routes/sidebar.tsx](routes/sidebar.tsx)).

These are the routes that will show in the sidebar. They expect three properties:

- `path`: the destination;
- `name`: the name to be shown;
- `icon`: an icon to illustrate the item

Item that are used as dropdowns, like the Pages option, don't need a `path`, but expect a `routes` array of objects with `path` and `name`:

```js
// sidebar.js
{
  path: '/example/tables',
  icon: 'TablesIcon',
  name: 'Tables',
},
{
  icon: 'PagesIcon', // <-- this is used as a submenu, so no path
  name: 'Pages',
  routes: [
    // submenu
    {
      path: '/example/login',
      name: 'Login', // <-- these don't have icons
    },
    {
      path: '/example/create-account',
      name: 'Create account',
    },
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies :
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
